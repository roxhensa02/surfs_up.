# Surfs_Up.
## Overview of the analysis: 

**Explain the purpose of this analysis.**
As the surf and ice cream shop will be running throught the year, we wany to conduct analysis on two different months, a month during the summer June and a month during the winter, December. Comparing these two mnths will give better understanding on key differences of the temperature between these two months.


## Results: 
**Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.**

![Decemmber_Temperatures](https://github.com/roxhensa02/surfs_up./blob/main/December_Temps.PNG)
* As we can see from the results above, the average temperature is close between these two months. In June the average tempretarure is 74.9 degrees and in December is 71.0.
* The maximum temperature for these months is different by only 2 degrees, where the maximum temperature for June is 85 degrees and for December is 83.
* However, there is asignificant differece between the lowest temperature by almost 8 degrees. The lowest temperature recorded for the month of June is 64 and for December is 56. This cdefference causing the percentiles to look different for these two months. 


## Summary:
**Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.**

Based on the results of our analysis, we can determine that these two months do not have sinificant differences. As the standard deviation and the average temperature are very close, we can suggest that the shop will perform good in both these months. To gather more weather data and determine how is affecting in different station, we can perform a query comparing the stations. These will highlight the station with more data, and we can also determine the weather changes on these stations.
